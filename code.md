He are some links to software I have made and that I find useful.

### Software I Use

* [Julia][julia] -- easy to use like MATLAB, and runs fast like C. I have made (minor) contributions to several packages.
    * [JuliaLang][juliagit] -- the git repo
    * [GaussianProcesses.jl][gps] -- simple GP toolbox
    * [Mocha.jl][mocha] -- neural network toolbox (similar to caffe)
    * [Graphs.jl][graphs] -- toolbox for building, visualizing, and creating graphs
    * [LightGraphs.jl][lgraphs] -- another graphs toolbox, when you don't need all of the fancy stuff
