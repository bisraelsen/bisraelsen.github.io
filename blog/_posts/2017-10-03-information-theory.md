I have been ruminating on this idea for quite a while. Even before I re-entered school to get a PhD, I was looking for a class in information theory to take on my arrivad (something that didn't happen BTW). This came up again this semester when I finally saw an information theory class come up in the course catalog, but I talked myself out of it because it was more focused around the traditional application of information theory to communications.I

Anyway, I saw [this article][1] pop up in my feed the other day, and it inspired me to take the idea back up. So, I am going to read through it and take some notes... I'll probably also put some of my own ideas in.
