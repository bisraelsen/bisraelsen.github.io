This is a place where I will post thoughts on interesting papers, or go through some interesting math, or pontificate on some technical subject.

This blog will, as a general rule, be very rough. I am not going to take a lot of time to proof-read all of my entries. I will be just trying to get ideas down "on paper"; sometimes as notes to myself and other times as quick ideas that I hope might get others thinking. Basically, I'm not getting paid to make a blog, so the main person I'm trying to benefit with this is myself.
