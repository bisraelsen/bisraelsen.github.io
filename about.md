I am currently a PhD student in the department of Computer Science at CU, Boulder. I am a member of the [COHRINT][cohrint] lab that is advised by Nisar R. Ahmed. I am affiliated with both [C-UAS][cuas] and [RECUV][recuv].

My research focuses on algorithms for human-robot interaction. More specifically, what tools are needed for humans and robots to work together on teams. To that end I use various machine learning algorithms. One key idea I call *circumspective agents*, which is supposed to convey the idea of an agent being able to be introspective *and* extrospective. Or in other words:

* Introspective -- Capability to analyze internal processes and capabilities
* Extrospective -- Capability to analyze external environment and surroundings

A circumspective agent has the tools to analyze and quantify certain properties. Of course, in a team situation, any analysis is severely weakened if it can't be *expressed* to something else in a meaningful way. Consequently, I focus on autonomous agents being able to express their circumspective analysis to humans. As a consequence, I study the interpretability and explainability of different machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. This expression is intended to *calibrate* the trust of human team members.
